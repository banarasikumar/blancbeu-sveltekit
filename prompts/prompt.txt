The problem is when there is no pwa app installed in the smartphone and I open the link "https://blancbeu.in" it displays App install Prompt/UI

And similarly if there is no pwa app installed in the smartphone and I open the link "https://blancbeu.in/staff" it displays App install Prompt/UI

and 

When there is no pwa app installed in the smartphone and I open the link "https://blancbeu.in/admin" it displays App install Prompt/UI

But.

When there is no pwa app installed in the smartphone and I open the link "https://blancbeu.in" it displays App install Prompt/UI

And if I install the main User app, and then, open the link in browser "https://blancbeu.in/staff"
or "https://blancbeu.in/admin"

It does not display the install app prompt/UI for either of apps.

And when there is no pwa app installed in the smartphone and I open the link "https://blancbeu.in/staff" it displays App install Prompt/UI for Staff app installation

And if I install the staff app, and when only staff app has been installed in the smartphone and then I open this link in browser

"https://blancbeu.in/admin" it displays the app install Prompt/UI for the admin app installation.


And if there is only staff app has been installed in the smartphone and then I open this link in browser

"https://blancbeu.in" it displays the app install Prompt/UI for the main user app installation.

So find out the problem, why when I install the user app only then it doesn't displays app install Prompt/UI for other apps, but when I install wether admin app or staff app it's displays app installation prompt/UI for other app.

And there is another but.

When I install all 3 apps by installing first staff app, admin app, and then main user app

And then if all 3 apps have installed in phone and I visit the link "https://blancbeu.in/admin"
It open the main user app

When I visit 

"https://blancbeu.in/staff"

Then also it open the main user app

And

When I visit 

"https://blancbeu.in"

Then also obviously it open the main user app.

Do you see the problem now?

Please fix it. No hallucinations.
